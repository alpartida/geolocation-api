# geolocation-api challenge

This code I created on Codesandbox for one of my SheCodes Challenges. After each lesson there is a small chanllenge to complete, this one involved using the Geolocation API. The Geolocation API allows the user to provide their location to web applications if they so desire. For privacy reasons, the user is asked for permission to report location information. In this code, I solve 3 challenges, one being the implementing the Geolocation API.
